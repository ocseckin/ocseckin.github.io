Currently, I am an M.Sc. Data Science student at Sabancı University and a member of VRL Lab. My research focuses on the well-being and my ultimate goal is to raise public’s awareness of mental and physical health issues.

In my projects, I collect data by APIs or webscraping techniques and use machine learning and deep learning models to draw inferences.

I got my Bachelor’s degree from Galatasaray University Economics. Following the graduation, I worked in İş Bankası as a Credit Analyst where I was involved in projects about credit risk evaluation, monitoring and loan automation.
