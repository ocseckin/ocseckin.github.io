I am an Informatics Ph.D. student at [Indiana University - Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html). My research focuses on establishing strategies for analyzing online behaviors in order to increase well-being and address public issues using internet data. Diffusion of dis- and misinformation on social media, uncovering behavioral embeddings of communities, science of science and polarization are among my subjects of interest.

I got a bachelor’s degree in Economics from [Galatasaray University](https://gsu.edu.tr/en/) and received a master's degree in Data Science from [Sabancı University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en), and worked as a member of [VRL Lab](http://varollab.com/) under the supervision of [Dr. Onur Varol](http://www.onurvarol.com/).
