Currently, I am an M.Sc. Data Science student at [Sabanci University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/), a member of [VRL Lab](http://varollab.com/) and working with [Onur Varol, Ph.D](http://www.onurvarol.com/). My research focuses on the well-being and my ultimate goal is to raise public awareness of mental and physical health issues.

In my projects, I collect data by APIs or webscraping techniques and use machine learning and deep learning models to draw inferences.

I got my Bachelor’s degree from [Galatasaray University](https://gsu.edu.tr/en/) Economics. Following the graduation, I worked in [İş Bankası](https://www.isbank.com.tr/en) as a Credit Analyst where I was involved in projects about credit risk evaluation, monitoring and loan automation. I have two internship experiences in [Denizbank](https://www.denizbank.com/en/) - Equity Research, and [Borusan Logistics](https://www.borusanlojistik.com/en) - Strategic Marketing
