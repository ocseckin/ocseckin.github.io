I am an Informatics Ph.D. student at [Indiana University - Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html). My research interests lie in modeling opinion dynamics through the integration of belief systems to understand the conditions under which polarization occurs in populations. This understanding can guide the development of optimal intervention strategies. Additionally, I am interested in leveraging AI systems to mitigate affective polarization. This involves using machine learning models to refine recommender systems and employing large language models to facilitate rapport-building among people.

I got a bachelor’s degree in Economics from [Galatasaray University](https://gsu.edu.tr/en/) and received a master's degree in Data Science from [Sabancı University](https://www.sabanciuniv.edu/en), and worked as a member of [VRL Lab](http://varollab.com/) under the supervision of [Dr. Onur Varol](http://www.onurvarol.com/).
